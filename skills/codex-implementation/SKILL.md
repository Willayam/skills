description: Ask Codex CLI (gpt-5.5) to implement a scoped, well-specified change with repo write access, then verify its diff. This is how gpt-5.5 is invoked for implementation work. Use when the user asks Claude to have Codex or gpt-5.5 build or edit code, when the model-selection rubric routes bulk or clear-spec implementation to gpt-5.5, or for mechanical changes, migrations, and clear-spec features. For work Claude should implement itself, use the normal editing flow instead.

# Codex Implementation

Use Codex to implement a scoped, clearly specified change with repo write access. Keep Claude
as the planner and verifier: define the scope, hand it off, then inspect the diff.

## Workflow

1. Pin the current state with `git status --short` and note any user changes already present.
2. Define the implementation scope: files or behavior to change, files to avoid, constraints, and verification commands.
3. Create a temporary artifact directory for Codex's report.
4. Run `codex exec` with repo write access.
5. After Codex exits, inspect `git status` and `git diff`.
6. Run the cheapest reliable verification yourself when practical.
7. Report what Codex changed, what Claude verified, and any remaining risks.

Use this command shape:

```bash
ARTIFACT_DIR="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/codex-implementation.XXXXXX")"
REPORT="$ARTIFACT_DIR/report.md"
PROMPT="$ARTIFACT_DIR/prompt.md"

# Write a self-contained prompt to $PROMPT, then run:
codex exec \
  -C "$PWD" \
  --add-dir "$ARTIFACT_DIR" \
  -s workspace-write \
  -o "$REPORT" \
  "$(cat "$PROMPT")"
```

Use `-s workspace-write` by default. Use `-s danger-full-access` only when the implementation
truly needs access outside the repo, app launch automation, simulator work, package manager
global state, or other machine-level operations.

## Prompt Requirements

Tell Codex:

- The exact implementation goal and acceptance criteria.
- The repo path and current branch context if relevant.
- Which existing patterns, files, or tests to inspect first.
- That it must preserve unrelated user changes.
- That it must not commit, push, deploy, or edit global config.
- Which verification commands to run, or to explain why they were skipped.
- To write a concise final report with files changed, verification, and unresolved questions.

Keep the task bounded. If the requested work bundles several substantial changes, split it into
separate Codex runs or ask the user to choose the first scope.

## Example Prompt

```text
You are implementing a scoped change for Claude.

Repository: /absolute/path/to/repo
Artifact directory: /tmp/codex-implementation.xxxxxx

Goal:
- Add keyboard navigation to the command palette.

Acceptance criteria:
- ArrowUp and ArrowDown move the highlighted item.
- Enter selects the highlighted item.
- Escape closes the palette.
- Existing mouse behavior keeps working.

Constraints:
- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Do not commit, push, deploy, or edit global config.
- Follow existing component and test patterns.

Verification:
- Run the focused component tests if available.
- Otherwise run the nearest relevant typecheck or test command and explain the choice.

Report:
- Files changed
- Behavioral summary
- Verification run and result
- Anything blocked or uncertain
```

## Review After Codex

Always inspect Codex's diff before telling the user the work is done. Revert only Codex-created
mistakes when you are sure they are not user changes. If Codex leaves the repo in a worse state
or changes unrelated files, stop and report the issue with the diff summary.

If `codex` is not installed or the command fails, report the error and offer to implement the
change directly instead.
